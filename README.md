## 🚀 CognoRise InfoTech Data Science Internship 🚀
Welcome to my GitHub repository for the CognoRise InfoTech Data Science Internship! Here, I'll be documenting my journey and progress through various tasks aimed at enhancing my skills in data science.

## 📅 Overview 📅
This internship program spans 30 days, from June 10, 2024, to July 10, 2024. Throughout this period, I'll be engaging in hands-on tasks designed to deepen my understanding of key concepts in data science and machine learning.This internship offers a comprehensive experience in data science, focusing on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Machine Learning (ML). Interns will gain practical skills in data manipulation, visualization, and the application of machine learning algorithms to solve real-world problems.

## 🎯 Tasks to be completed for the complition of Internship 🎯

# Task 2: Credit Card Fraud Detection :

In this task, I'll develop a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. This involves preprocessing and normalizing transaction data, handling class imbalance, training classification algorithms, and evaluating the model's performance using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score. The notebook for this task can be found at task2_transactions-fraud-detection/credit-card-fraud-detection.ipynb.

# Task 7: Shopper Sentiments :

Task 7 involves analyzing the ShopperSentiments dataset, which contains over 250,000 customer reviews on TeePublic. Using this data, I'll explore sentiment analysis, geospatial patterns, temporal trends, and review categorization to gain insights into customer preferences in online fashion retail. The notebook for this task can be found at task7_shopper-sentiments/shopper-sentiments.ipynb.

# Task 8: Fake News Prediction :

In Task 8, I'll work with the Fake News Prediction Dataset to build predictive models capable of identifying fake news articles. By analyzing features such as title and text, I aim to contribute to efforts in combating misinformation and promoting media literacy. The notebook for this task can be found at task8_fake-news-prediction/fake-news-prediction.ipynb.
